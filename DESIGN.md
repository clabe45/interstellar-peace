## The Big Idea

While trying to attain complete power over the Known Planets, the Grand Interstellar Confederation plans to annex the Independent States of Uktar 2. Knowing that this nation is one of its last hopes, the Subfederate Operations desperately tries to defend it from the might of the GIC. The SO quickly hires many free citizens, one of which is the player. The player's job is to decode GIC transmissions and learn as much as he can before it is too late. Now that you've seen how the SO works, you can either stay with them or choose a different path. This is the start of your journey in the galaxy.

## Play Mechanic

Being a text-adventure game, the player will interact with the game through text. She can see descriptions of what her surroundings are, as well as some prior knowledge. Every action the player makes outside of her job is a choice from multiple options. Though not the only interaction, the core gameplay is the job, which is one from the following (depending on the player's choice):
- *Decoding enemy transmissions* - The player will receive several characters along with their respective numerical codes (from previously attained intel) of decoded messages and their corresponding plain text versions. She will try to find the relationship between them. Then, she will decode an intercepted enemy message.
- *Fighting on the front lines* - The player will receive a weapon. During the battle, she must use quick hand-eye coordination to enter letters for different moves, and surprisingly, timing is vital.
- More TBD

## Target Audience

Targeted for people who like text-adventure games, unique combat mechanics, mathematical problems, or just sci-fi games in general.

## Concept

{name} is an action game in which you are part of an initiative, known as the Subfederate Operations, to stop the Grand Interstellar Confederation from taking over the Known Planets.
Winning each episode (level) is different for each job. For decoding, it is successfully decoding the enemy transmission. For fighting on the front lines, it is surviving. ...
{name} defies the laws of text-adventure games, as it provides a strong action element to the gameplay.
{name} should provide equal chances of winning and losing. Furthermore, if you die, the game is over, and you have to start from scratch. Also, if you miss an GIC transmission and SO relies on you, you run the risk of getting a city destroyed by the GIC.
The game starts out solely from your small world--trying to make ends meet--and works towards the big picture of the interstellar war.
You will face many decisions and many challenges to your skill.

## Introduction

```
[Recruiter] Hello, name?
> Thomas
[Recruiter] Ok... what position are you applying for?
(1) Army
(2) Infiltration
(3) Navy?
> 2
[You] Infiltration
The recruiter then asks you a series of questions, including your height, weight, work experiences, etc.
[Recruiter] Alright, thank you. You can take a seat until Captain Jantor calls you.

You sit down, taking in your surroundings. The room is dark and concealed... well, it had to be; the GIC isn't blind after all. There are several other potential recruitees sitting down--some look poor, while others look wealthy... why would they be helping the SO if they aren't here to make ends meet?
[A man's voice] {your name; idk how to get that yet}?
[You] Yes.
You get up and see a thin, tall man with dark brown hair, dressed in white. He smiles at you, and leads the way into a surprisingly-bright hallway. ...
